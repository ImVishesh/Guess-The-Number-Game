# Guess-The-Number-Game


How to play?
The application randomly selects a number from 1-100 and the number is hidden from the user. User has to guess the number within 20 attempts. Initially the score is 20 and with each wrong attempt the score gets decreased by 1.
Player's goal is to guess the number within 20 attempts otherwise he/she will loose the game.
If you want to restart the game you can click on Again button displayed on screen.

I wrote this game when I was learing web development and I build this project under the instructions of my instructor. It is written in HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.

Keep Enjoying!!!
